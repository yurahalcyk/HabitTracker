PREMISE:
- Create a habit tracker with the ability to create new user accounts to track personalised habits that the user is trying
to implement into their life.

FLOW:
- Create a new user or login to already created account
- if new user: prompted what habits they want to implement into their life
- if user exists: habits page loads
- user will then be able to toggle months and weeks within month to see the habits they want to complete for each day
- the days will be presented in a list, with each element being able to be expanded to display the habits
- the user will then work through each day ticking off the habit completed
- this data should be saved to a database so the user can track whether or not they are building the habit

INITIAL HABIT PAGE:
- habit page will consist a month toggler and week toggler
- days will be broken down in a list, with the predetermined habits pre populating each day for the week and month
- allow for user to edit each habit within the list with notes
- the user should be able to tick off completed habits
